    <h1>High School Projects</h1>
    <p>This page contains <u>some</u> of my highschool projects throughout high school! A lot of these are fundamental projects that helped me apply the general basics
    of programming that I've learned, taking something new and completely adapting and building upon it!</p>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <div class="final-thoughts">
          <p>Although the code is very messy, I learnt a lot about the process of looking at uknown libraries and figuring out how to use their interface.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Two things I would do better going back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean up the code and make it wayyy more readable</li>
            <li>Tie the button press switch to an interrupt pin instead of polling it in the loop</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The loop polling works, however, there is a slight delay when pressing the button to change the image.</p>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>     
        <div class="final-thoughts">
          <p> This was one of my most favorite projects since it was the first biggest step I had ever taken toward building and working with custom hardware. I was so scared
            that I would have purchased incompatible parts, or I would mess up the soldering (which I did do a few times), and would never finish this project. However, after a lot of trial and error, 
            I managed to get everything working and it was such a rewarding experience!  
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>If I were to go back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Would have used wire crimps instead of alligator clips. The fact that I used alligator clips is silly (made wiring a mess), but was worried I would do 
              something wrong with crimps. Thankfully comfortable with using them now</li>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand what an API is</li>
          <li>Understand how to use APIs from a specific source (POSTMAN)</li>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>     
        <div class="final-thoughts">
          <p> These skills definentely became critical in later projects where I needed to fetch data from other interfaces
            such as AdafruitIO and local servers. I also got more comfortable with the TFT display library and how to render text on the screen.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>If I were to go back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>With the experience now, I would've messed around a little more with the TFT display library and get my username
              and profile picutre to display on the screen as well (I was having trouble with this at the time)
            </li>
            <li> Would've handeled the screen referesh better. When fetching data from the API, the number is blacked out on the 
              screen. I would have waited for the API to first recieve data before refereshing the screen so the screen doesn't have to 
              empty itself first.

        <h4>Goals</h4>

          <p>Although I didn't get to finish the full project and manual, the experience gained helped me format some of the 
            curriculum for Tech Club and CircuitCharm.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Two things I would do better going back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a more organzied project plan (was kind of figuring it out as I go)</li>
            <i>TFT screen got cracked twice through travel, stopped the project after since cost for part is high and was a 
              large time time setback.
            </i>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>If I were to continue this project:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete the interactive software tutorials on the TFT display</li>
            <li>Add more sensor modules and expansion options</li>
