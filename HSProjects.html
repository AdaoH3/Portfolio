    <h1>High School Projects</h1>
    <p>This page contains <u>some</u> of my highschool projects throughout high school! A lot of these are fundamental projects that helped me apply the general basics
    of programming that I've learned, taking something new and completely adapting and building upon it!</p>

        <p> Task: Use a TFT Display to display and cycle through 3 different GIFS with a button </p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand how Images Display / Render (Used image to C command line tools)</li>
          <li>Get use to using display libraries for TFTs</li>
          <li>Expirement with what I can do by adding a button scroll function for the GIFs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <ul class="inline-tags">
          <li>Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <div class="final-thoughts">
          <p>Although the code is very messy, I learnt a lot about the process of looking at uknown libraries and figuring out how to use their interface.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Two things I would do better going back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean up the code and make it wayyy more readable</li>
            <li>Tie the button press switch to an interrupt pin instead of polling it in the loop</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The loop polling works, however, there is a slight delay when pressing the button to change the image.</p>

        <p> Task: Build a budget friendly rhythm game controller (The usual ones average around $188!!) </p>
        <img class="project-video right-float" src="images/hsProjImages/rhythmGame.gif" alt="Rhythm Game Controller Demo">
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the electronics behind a controller</li>
          <li>Understand button interrupts and debouncing</li>
          <li>Understand how a rotary encoder works and how can be used to move mouse position for software with a microcontroller</li>
          <li>Alter and mess around code to get controller to have a mode switching function for different software's reading input</li>
          <li>Fully build and execute first big project!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Skills Learnt</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Soldering</li>
          <li>How to Crimp + Learn what is a Daisy Chain</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Components</h4>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>     
        <div class="final-thoughts">
          <p> This was one of my most favorite projects since it was the first biggest step I had ever taken toward building and working with custom hardware. I was so scared
            that I would have purchased incompatible parts, or I would mess up the soldering (which I did do a few times), and would never finish this project. However, after a lot of trial and error, 
            I managed to get everything working and it was such a rewarding experience!  
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>If I were to go back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Would have used wire crimps instead of alligator clips. The fact that I used alligator clips is silly (made wiring a mess), but was worried I would do 
              something wrong with crimps. Thankfully comfortable with using them now</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The loop polling works, however, there is a slight delay when pressing the button to change the image.</p>
